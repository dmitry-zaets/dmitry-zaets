### About me
Within the last 13 years, I have worked in numerous startups, helping them grow from early-stage prototypes to fully functional products.

I am a full-stack developer focused on software architecture and developer experience.

I've been a co-organizer and active member of the [BarcelonaJS](https://barcelonajs.com/) community since 2017.
